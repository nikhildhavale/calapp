### This is huge using cursor to develop an ios app. Something new for me

Your goal is to develop mobile App via swift A to Z, from design, to fully functional app. all via vibe coding, using cursor and SweetPad, xCode, we are looking for someone that wants to build lots of mobile apps at scale.
Follow this guide to build ios App:

The test is to build an app that takes picture of a good, and analysis its calories and nutrient, similar to CalAI concept, https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cal-ai-calorie-tracker/id6480417616
 You can use any AI Agents and Tools in order to complete faster and better!


Build a fully functional iOS app using Cursor, SweetPad, and AI agent-based development workflows, replicating the features of CalAI—an app that analyzes food calories from a photo using OpenAI’s multimodal API.

Task Scope:
1. App Concept:
Develop an iOS Swift app that:
Takes a photo of food.


Uses OpenAI Vision API to analyze ingredients and calorie info.


Allows editing of analyzed data.


Saves logs to a calendar history.



Candidate Must Use:
Cursor (AI IDE)


SweetPad (VS Code iOS extension)


Xcode (project base only)


OpenAI Vision API with structured JSON response


GitHub (for commits)


Real iOS device or Simulator (SweetPad integration required)



Deliverables:
Fully Working iOS App:


Working camera capture (on device/simulator).


API integration with OpenAI (use test key).


Editable ingredient view with real-time calorie update.


History/calendar log view for food records.


Development Assets:


instruction.md: PRD document with features, API, and data models.


.cursor-rules: Your custom cursor rules used in project.


README.md: Installation + build steps.


GitHub repo with commit history:


Each feature must have separate commits with titles like feat: implement camera, fix: calorie update bug.



Evaluation Criteria:
Use of AI tools (Cursor, SweetPad, LLM prompting)


Working feature set


Debugging via Cursor AI logs


Code structure: MVVM preferred


UI: Basic, but functional


Clarity in instruction.md and .cursor-rules



Deadline:
72 hours after task start.
